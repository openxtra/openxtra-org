description: An experiment to build a constraint workbench.
---

I've had an [itch to build a constraint workbench tool for a very long time](https://techteapot.com/strange-case-of-the-missing-application/). Constraint Workbench is my attempt to build a prototype of how I think it should work. The good news is that I think I have at least partially succeeded.

The project has been under intermittent development since April 2015 in my 5 o'clock time i.e. the time I give myself to work on speculative or educational projects between 5 and 6pm Monday to Friday. The sources are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/digitalbricklayer/workbench).
